The Journal of the History of Biology just published my http://doi.org/10.1007/s10739-017-9491-x[study on the history of sociobiology], and this blog post explains where this project came from.

My PhD studies focused on the post-war history of the relations between economics and biology, in the US context.
An interesting episode of these relations is how economists reacted to http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674002357[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis], a book by Edward O. Wilson published in 1975 which suggested human social behavior (including economic behavior) was shaped by biological evolutionnary forces.
Anyway, my http://www.sudoc.abes.fr/DB=2.1/SRCH?IKT=12&TRM=076610527[Masters thesis] was devoted to this topic, and a chapter of https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00372263[my PhD dissertation] expands on it.

The consensus is that the "deep history" of sociobiology lays in Edward O. Wilson reading https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4[William Hamilton's papers fom 1964 on kin selection], providing the key to a synthesis of all patterns of animal social behavior under a brand new name, "sociobiology".

Doing even just preliminay historical research on sociobiology, I was disturbed by some anomalies.
A search on "sociobiology" returns documents published well before Edward O. Wilson's use of the term: sometimes coincidentally, but at other times in the context of American animal social behavior studies, in the 1940S and 1950s.

In 1956, a https://esa.org/history/animal-behavior-section/[Section On Animal Behavior and Sociobiology] was created within the Ecological Society of America, independently of Wilson, and it gained more than 300 members in less than a year.
Who were these people??

Since the history of sociobiology was peripherical to my subject, I ignored the question. But several readings kept suggesting a historical frame for sociobiology different from the one which makes it all start with Edward O. Wilson. So I ended up devoting some time trying to make it into a coherent whole.

A key point is the conference organized by behavioral geneticist J.P. Scott in 1946 à Bar Harbor, gathering prominent representatives from ecology (ecology in the sense of animal or behavioral ecology) and comparative psychology, with the felt presence of ethology (of Konrard Lorenz fame) as well.

This conference ended up promoting the naturalist way of doing animal behavior studies, in the outdoor, defending it against rat / lab studies which were becoming the modern orthodoxy.
Participants to the conference used "sociobiology" to call their way of studying animal behavior, making room for field-based as well as lab-based research.
This burgeoned into the Animal Behavior Society, founded in 1964.

Is Wilson's sociobiology unrelated to this earlier sociobiology project by scientists self-identifying as naturalists?
Reading Wilson's autobiography, entitled https://islandpress.org/book/naturalist[Naturalist], many cues made me suspect that Wilson's motives to develop sociobiology were not that different from the ones of earlier sociobiologists.
Can different traditions of practicing science, the naturalist way vs the lab way, be of value to craft a historical narrative of sociobiology?

It happens that http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo3640043.html[a magistral book by Robert Kohler] makes the case that place / location is an important dimension in defining competing scientific "cultures" (I didn't use Knorr Cetina concept of http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674258945[epistemic cultures], but that's the idea).
Kohler specifically studies naturalist vs lab styles of research.
I realized it illustrated quite well what had happened in this Bar Harbor conference and later.

The same pattern of defensive alliance by naturalists can be found with the 2 next incarnations of sociobiology: http://doi.org/10.1002/9781119179313.wbprim0260[Stuart Altmann], doctoral student of E. O. Wilson in touch with some of the participants to the Bar Harbor conference, and then E. O. Wilson himself.
They were all naturalists at a time when American science was redirecting funds and prestige towards lab-based research, which adopts a reductionist approach and mathematical formalisms - far from "jungle studies".

To give an idea, Wilson was in the same department at Harvard as James Watson, the co-discoverer of the DNA structure.
Imagine the pressure to establish your scientific credentials, when you are a naturalist like Wilson wearing boots to study ants in the field, next to a person who discovered the mechanism of heredity standing in a lab!

I explain a motive for Wilson's sociobiology just like the motives for J.P. Scott and Stuart Altmann's sociobiologies: an attachment to the naturalist way of doing science (attention to the whole animal and its social relations in groups, in natural conditions of observations), by combining naturalist and new formal approaches (lab studies, sophisticated mathematical formalism) into a synthesis.

This what the paper is really about. The argument is made by connecting existent histories of various fields (ecology, comparative psychology, ethology, population ecology, and socobiology) with the help of some key archival evidence on the aftermath of the 1946 Bar Harbor conference.

I like the result for a couple of reasons:

- it traces a history of sociobiology independently from the sociobiology debate: the accusations of biological determinism following the publication of E. O. Wilson's book in 1975.
This debate received a proper sociological, historical and philosophical examination (by https://www.amazon.com/Defenders-Truth-Sociobiology-Ullica-Segerstrale/dp/0192862154[Segerstrale] and https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/vaulting-ambition[Kitcher] in paticular), but it tended to capture the history of sociobiology under one angle, which happened after the publication in 1975.
My paper unearthes motives and dynamics which shaped sociobiology independently from what happened post-1975.

- it relies heavily on the secondary literature.
It is common to read outstanding work in the history of science, to end up referencing one page here, or a paragraph there.
For this paper, I had to rely extensively on a couple of impressive studies which were really doing the heavy lifting: Robert Kohler's work on the role of place in scientific practices (http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo3640043.html[Kohler 2002]), Greg Mitman's opus on the history of ecology at the University of Chicago (http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo3643334.html[Mitman 1992]), the series of articles on cybernetics and animal studies by Donna Haraway culminating into a book (https://www.amazon.com/Primate-Visions-Gender-Nature-Science/dp/0415902940[Haraway 1989]), or the history of ethology by Richard Burkhadt (http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo3640703.html[2005]) (and others).
It is a pleasure to put these references to work once again, and make them shed a bright light on a different time period or scientific field they had focused on.

- there is a smoking gun, found in the archives.
There is plenty of evidence that the 3 sociobiology projects discussed in the paper are driven by a need to defend the naturalist credo in animal behavior studies.
But explicit evidence digged from an archival source is always great to corroborate. And this what I found in the correspondence between Scott and Schneirla (a comparative psychologist who had done field studies), following the Bar Harbo conference:

[quote, Scott to Schneirla, July 9 1948 Box M579 Folder "Conferences: Behavior Committee" -  Theodore C Schneirla Papers - Archives of the History of American Psychology - The University of Akron]
_____
All of this, I think, will tend to work in the direction of both building up interest in animal behavior and sociobiology and thereby making it possible to do what we talked about at the [New York] conference, namely to organize a new journal for this type of work. In spite of the cordial attitude of the editors of various existing journals, my own experience and that of others who have worked in the field leads me to believe that it is often very difficult to fit papers to the individual requirements of these journals.
